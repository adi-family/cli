## Styling Guidelines
- Prefer inline Tailwind classes over BEM naming conventions
- Use BEM only when truly necessary (complex component state management, third-party library integration)
- Keep styles co-located with components using Tailwind utility classes

## Icons
- Use Lucide icons for all iconography
